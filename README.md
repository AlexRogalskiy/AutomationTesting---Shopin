# AutomationTesting---Shopin

You can use this `production-like` app as you consider but it was meant for automation testing (e.g, Protractor, Cypress, Selenium, even unit tests).

To run the Shopin app you should follow these steps (after cloning/downloading the repo):

- Install MySQL 8 and execute the script `shopin_sql.sql`. This will install the `Shopin` database.
- Run the `fakeSMTP-2.0.jar`. Double click on it and after start, press `Start the server`. This is just a simple email service.
- Run the `Shopin-1.0.jar` via `java -jar Shopin-1.0.jar`
- Open the browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`

If you want to play on code then you should know that this is a Spring Boot / Hibernate JPA app.
